# Designing Functions

In this demo, we will study the process of designing functions. 
We will follow the 5-step process in our textbook *Practical Programming*, 
Chapter 3, called the **Function Design Recipe**. 

Every time you write a function, you need to answer the following questions:

* What do you name the function? 
* What are the argumants, and what types of information do they represent?
* What calculations are you doing with that information?
* What does the function return?
* Does it work as expected?


The five steps are as follows:

1. **Examples** Type a few example calls and determine what it should return for those values. 
The name of your function should indicate what is being calculated in your examples. 
1. **Header** Type some documentation relating to your function. 
It should be clear to the reader what arguments it takes as input and what value is returned and the types of each variable. 
1. **Description** Write a few sentences to describe what your function does. 
1. **Body** By now, you should be clear about how your function will work. 
Now type the code to perform the calculations. 
1. **Test** Run the examples from step 1 to verify that your function works as expected.
