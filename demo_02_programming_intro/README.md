Computer programming languages are, literally, languages. 
It is not a metaphor.
In Google, a language is defined as "the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way."
A computer programming language is a written method of communication for the communication of instructions to a computer. 
Like other languages, programming languages have parts of speech, syntax and punctuation.
