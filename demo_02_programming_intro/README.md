# Introduction to Programming

Computer programming languages are, literally, languages. 
It is not a metaphor.
In Google, a language is defined as "the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way."
A computer programming language is a written method of communication for the communication of instructions to a computer. 
Like other languages, programming languages have parts of speech, syntax and punctuation. 


## Nouns

Variables, objects. 


Data types. 


In the languages we will use, Values are represented in binary.

## Verbs




### Operators 

### Assignment operator

Before we can perform any operations, a variables has to be initialized with an assignment operator. 


### Arithmetic operators


### Relational operators


### Functions



## Prepositions, Conjunctions and Adverbs 

Conditional logic is what permits the great flexibility of programming languages for designing algorithms. 
It detrmines under what conditions an operation is to be performed. 


### ```if``` statements

```R
if (condition) {
    # Execute statements when condition is TRUE.
    # ...
}

# Continue with remaining statements in any case.
```


### ```if```...```else``` statements

```R
if (condition) {
    # Execute statements when condition is TRUE.
    # ...
} else {
    # Execute statements when condition is FALSE.
}
```


### ```for``` loops

```R
for (object in list_of_iterators) {
    # Execute statements for each object in the list of iterators.
    # ...
}
```


### ```while``` loops

```R

while (condition) {
    # Execute statements when condition is TRUE.
    # ...
    # condition may change during an iteration.
    # ...
    # At end of block, evaluate condition and determine whether
    # to execute the code block again. 
}
```
